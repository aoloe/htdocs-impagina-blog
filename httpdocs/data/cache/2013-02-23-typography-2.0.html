<p>One of the main topics for DTP is typography. This means two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being able to control the typographic characteristics of the text.</li>
<li>Having good tools for fixing typographics problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this work needs some control on the way the reader will "consume" your work:</p>

<ul>
<li>a specific width of the column,</li>
<li>a specific size for the text,</li>
<li>the availabibility of a specific font.</li>
</ul>

<p>For years, designers have beeing fighting hard to bring this to the web. We have had a huge</p>

<p>Now it's all about Responsive design (really, I start missing a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFhjDX-DUew">Shit Responsive Design Fanatics Say</a> video...) which – as a side effect – leads to a lost of control on the text flow.</p>

<p>Here an <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5268262">interesting spat</a> out of a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5267990">mostly uninspiring Hacker News discussion on font size in the Web</a> (Uninspiring? Every reader would like the designers to stop messing with text size and every designer would love it if the browsers would always show the text at the size she feels it's the best one: so what?).</p>

<p>Only if you stop using fully-justified text first.</p>

<p>What's wrong with justified text? I prefer reading justified text.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>andyharl</p>

<p>Justified text is fine in printed material when a certain amount of control can be exercised to make sure that terrible things don't happen.</p>

<p>Browsers are horrible at justifying text.</p></li>

<p>Reducing the typographic features to the "Greatest common devisor"... it does not look like a bright future for typography.</p>

Subject: [scribus-dev] Tools of Change

<p>a.l.e posted something on his blog about this:</p>

<p>http://impagina.org/blog/2013-01-12-oreilly-tools-of-change-for-publishing</p>

<p>I went to the link and what impresses me is that these people are 
talking about multidirectional publishing, but pretty clearly starting 
from the point-of-view of ebooks, then having the option to turn that 
into a PDF for print, plus other formats.</p>

<p>I have no argument against people doing this, since for one thing, 
they're going to do it anyway, but I think there is the expectation of a 
slide of publishing to an inferior quality. We're not likely to see 
high-quality output for print, microtypography and other advanced 
typographical features. This also feeds into the need for a professional 
publisher, O'Reilly for example, who will be needed to clean up 
someone's work to the level it needs to be for actual printing.</p>

<p>More sensible, but more difficult, is the approach of starting from the 
high-quality end, such as with Scribus, then translating to low quality 
output such as ebooks when desired. We know that this isn't 
straightforward, but from a practical workflow point-of-view is more 
sensible.</p>
