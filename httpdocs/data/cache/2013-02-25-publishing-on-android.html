<p>During the past weekend, I've made my first steps in Android programming. It was fun!</p>

<p>One question sticks: what would it be like, to do publishing work (yes, I'm talking about publishing content by using an android tablet, not about publishing apps on the Google Market!) thorugh a Tablet or a Phone?</p>

<p>If I think of using Scribus on a Tablet, well, not the best dreams...</p>

<p>But can't we think about it the other way round? What would it be like to prepare publications on a tablet? Who could have a use for it? What could be the targetted output?</p>

<p>A search through Google is not very promising:
- "Android publishing" only shows links on publishing apps to the Android platform
- "Android DTP" only shows one intersting thread (sea below) and some not really inspiring lists of Apps for designers
- "iPad DTP" shows the some true facts about design: designers are using Macs. There are some very interesting Apps to be found (see below) but most resources are about using DTP tools to produce content for the iPad.</p>

<li>http://www.dtptools.com/product.asp?id=idml "The iDML app allows you to edit stories from InDesign documents on your iPad. You can also assign any of the paragraph or character styles that are defined in the document to a selected piece of text."</li>
<li>https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/quark-designpad/id551786067 "Quark DesignPad is a unique iPad app that puts grid-based design control in the palm of your hand. Using an entirely new approach to design, you can quickly experiment with different layouts and create anything from a classified ad to a poster right on your iPad â€” then share it on Twitter, by email or further develop it in QuarkXPress. Whether you are a design student or a long-time professional, DesignPad can help you get your designs started and collaborate with colleagues, clients and friends."</li>
<li>but there are also people looking for Scribus for iPad! http://www.ipadforums.net/ipad-2-forum/49094-desktop-publisher-ipad.html</li>

<li>http://www.mactalk.com.au/59/109421-desktop-publishing-apps-ipad.html : at the end a list of dtp tools</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing should make us think a bit: DTP stands for "Desktop Publishing"... not "Tablet Publishing"... a sign that a paradigm change is needed?</p>
