<p>In the <a href="http://epaper.azione.ch/ee/azion/_main_/2013/02/11/039/">latest Azione</a> we can read about the Paola Dubini's book on the <a href="http://www.inmondadori.it/Voltare-pagina-Paola-Dubini/eai978887192659/">transformations in the books and in the publishing industry</a> and her thoughts about the characteristics that make the book on paper so valuable:</p>

<ul>
<li>The linear way of reading is still the preferred one.</li>
<li>The reader is accepting the choices made by the author or the person having organized the contents.</li>
<li>Le physical properties of paper (as an example for illustrated books)</li>
<li>The possibility to publish with high aesthetic standards or historical-philological value.</li>
<li>The chance to give a value to its conservation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stefano Vassere – the author of the Azione' article – adds a few more qualities one can attach to the books:</p>

<ul>
<li>the symbolic-affective value,</li>
<li>the tactile-perceptive sensation,</li>
<li>the chance to give them away,</li>
<li>the "consumption" traces,</li>
<li>and the traditional places where they are distributed and preserved.</li>
</ul>

<p>Seriously? Those are the reasons why I should spend all my freetime on Scribus? Sorry, I must say that I'm a bit deceived, here.</p>

<p>So, I'm trying to check the people around me, what they are their preferences and why:</p>

<p>Let's hear the opinion of two graphic designer:
- H. prefers books. She likes to doodle (kribeln) on them and she does not want to read on the computer monitor. A tablet or ereader is ok, but she still prefers the paper.
- E. only considers ebooks. She used to live in a small flat and paper is only taking room.</p>

<p>In my personal opinion, I clearly prefer to read books on paper. They feel better in the hands and it's very likely that they put less strain on my eyes than a monitor does. I'm pretty sure that this preference is also related to the heritage left behing by the hundreds of book I've held in my hands over my all life. (After having taken a big breath: why the tens of thousands of hours I've spent in front of an LCD monitor don't give me a similar skey towards ebooks? All I know is: it does not happen).</p>

<p>Despite this clear preference, since I've started to read ebooks on my 7' tablet a few months ago, I've a hard time for the three books that are laying around and are waiting to be read. In the same timeframe, I've started reading the third ebook. I've mostly been reading them while commuting or travelling, but also when I'm at home I tend to rather pick up the tablet than one of the books. This can mostly be explain the tablet being around exactly in those moments I happen to have some spare time. Still, it's a bit troubling to notice that my own behavior does not match my preferences.</p>

<p>This having been said, personally, I see some reasons why I <em>objectively</em> prefer reading books rather than ebooks:
- Skimming through a book to judge if the book is worth to be read or to find the parts that are relevant. I'm much faster and more successful by doing it on paper than by using the TOC and searching function on an ebook.
- Having a peak on the next few pages or the preceedeing ones and then going back to current reading place: also much easier with paper.
-</p>

<p>There are also a few other technical reason (like how easy is to take notes) but I believe that they are more related to the current stand of the technics rather than the intrinsic proprerties of books and ebooks.</p>

<p>But those are certainly not reasons that will motivate me to consider the printing on paper when planning the future of publishing software. I'm sorry for those who are hurt in their feeling but these words of mine, but this is has less to do with publishing, and more with sculptures and bildende kunst...</p>
