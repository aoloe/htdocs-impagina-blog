<p>One of the questions I'm asking myself is: what is a classical DTP program – a program like Scribus is – good for?</p>

<p>Two warnings:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't mean what it can be used for, but what it is really made for! Those use cases for which there are no better substitutes</li>
<li>I tend to value more, examples that take into account the curent trends in the publishing world.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what are those ues cases?</p>

<ul>
<li>Still none. But I'm not finished with building this list. In any case your feedback (on the Mailing list, as Ticket here on github or per private mail is welcome!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some usecases, where I'm still in doubt if a DTP program is best suited:</p>

<ul>
<li>Newsletter / Newspaper printed with Spot colors on offset presses. Currently, you still see some of them laying around, but I wonder how fast it's going to be replaced by digital versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having seen the "real" use cases for Scribus, I'd like to list the ones that I didn't judge as best fits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Packaging: a vector graphics program is probably better suited</li>
<li>Full color newsletter / small newspaper: the main target will probably be the net and they will probably be printed on Laser printers or on full colors. The extended color management from a DTP program may not that imporant anymore.</li>
</ul>
