<p>Looking at the Scribus users base, I see three main typologies:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>writers</em> self-publishing their works,</li>
<li><em>graphic designers</em> collecting texts from commissioners, giving it a readable form, and putting a nice skin around it,</li>
<li><em>publishers</em> collecting content from writers and looking for a more or less standard output.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those people have different needs and it's not an easy task to please of all of them.</p>

<p>During the next few months, I'll have a closer look to the ways the writing, design and publishing habits and requirements are evolving and how we can build software that people will use and love.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One tangential thought: we don't have to target all kinds of users. Even inside the typologies listed above, which are probably not even comprehensive. As an example, we don't have to please all the editors, but we may want to create software for a specific kind of editors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's start from the first type of users: the writers that want to take the whole workflow in their hands.</p>

<p>As a first appetizer two blog articles by two geeky authors who have recently written about publishing a tech book:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.filipekberg.se/2012/08/27/self-publishing-a-book-part-1-where-it-all-began/">Self-publishing a book</a> by Filip Ekberg, who wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/C-Smorgasbord-Filip-Ekberg/dp/1468152106/">book on C#</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://kyan.com/blog/2013/1/29/writing-is-hard-so-do-it">Writing is hard, so do it</a> by Neil Middleton who is currently writing a book about Heroku.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most interesting parts: both choose to go for tools that allow them to focus on the task of writing, and are directly typing some markup to generate the formatting in the targetted output.</p>

<p>The first one went with <a href="http://www.texniccenter.org/">TeXnicCenter</a>, an editor that helps writing LaTeX tags. The second one with IAwriter, an OS X text editor with spelling checking, Mardkown preview and remote storage on Dropbox. He is formatting his text with <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">Asciidoc</a>.</p>

<p>While we're been told that <a href="https://medium.com/design-startups/6c423fc5ccef">designers will have to learn to code</a>, it's still a very open question, how far are writers ready to go into the markup world...</p>

<p>All we know is that more and more people want to focus on they're writing and get a <a href="https://github.com/litewrite/litewrite">lite</a> or <a href="http://www.zenpen.io/">zen</a> experience..</p>
