<p>During the first days of the year, multiple statistics on the popularity of languages have been published. Not only we had some insight on the good shape of C++, but we also read the analysts explaining the popularity of the – otherwise so "obscure" – Objective-C, by its tight coupling with all development on iOS (iPhones and iPads). The finding that Java seems to be in better shape than people were predicting, is probably not unrelated either to its role in the Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>Today's post by Aaron Seigo (<a href="http://aseigo.blogspot.ch/2013/01/qml-component-apis-to-come-together.html">QML component API's to come together?</a>) suggests that QML – the new framework for all GUI work in Qt5 – has being adopted by all the new free Mobile operating system (KDE Plasma, Sailfish and Ubuntu) and that those systems may converge in a common Apps environment.</p>

<p>Seeing how healthy the Android and iOS markets are, I dare to postulate that choosing technologies which are popular for "mobile programming" could motivate people to contribute to a Desktop oriented project like Scribus... And it does not look like the worst way to get your software to be compatible with both the work at the desk and on the go...</p>

<p>Are Objective-C, Java and QML the languages of choice for future  tools? I must give QML a try!</p>
