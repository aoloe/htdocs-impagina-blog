<p>one of the problems are to get people to like the programming language you've chosen... and my experience with scribus is that people tend not to like c++.</p>

<p>on a previous post, we saw that c++ is still one of the languages that are most searched for... but there seem to be a difference between the number of people who google it, and the people who would love to program with it in their free time!</p>

<p>Yesterday, I 've been reading <a href="http://blog.carlsensei.com/post/42828735125">Google Go: The Good, the Bad, and the Meh</a> and, yes, I could conceive that Go – Also known as Golang – could be the right language to create the core of for a publishing engine:</p>

<ul>
<li>simple concurrency,</li>
<li>clean language,</li>
<li>utf8 support,</li>
<li>list and hashes,</li>
<li>much hyped and backed by Google...</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other side, nobody has done something like this yet, so it will be hard to build upon the shoulders of giants...</p>

<p>Go still does not have good bindings to GUI frameworks, but what hinders us from write in the GUI in different languages with a clear API to the core(s)?</p>
