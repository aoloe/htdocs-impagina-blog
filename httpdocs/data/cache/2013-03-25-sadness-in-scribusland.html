<pre><code>&lt;XXX&gt; There is sadness in scribus-land
&lt;SCR&gt; hi JonCruz
&lt;XXX&gt; I know of two major attempts to use Scribus that had issues
&lt;XXX&gt; One was an attempt at a magazine that ended up falling back to InDesign
&lt;SCR&gt; JonCruz: what kind of issue?
&lt;XXX&gt; usability, etc.
&lt;XXX&gt; Then there were the issues Scislac had with doing stuff for Scale
&lt;SCR&gt; well, the UI is very different from ID, that's for sure
&lt;XXX&gt; and getting things to function correctly at the printers
&lt;SCR&gt; that's all quite general. we'd need to know more

<p>Are those</p>
