<p>When you're a geek, Latex seems to be a good option for self-publishing your book... most of all if it's about programming!</p>

<ul>
<li>Are Latex files apted to be shared? Check.</li>
<li>Are Latex files compatible with revion systems? Check.</li>
<li>Are there WYSIWYG – or at lest "friendly" – editing frontends to Latex? ... well, it depends...</li>
<li>Would it possible to create a nice, powerful, friend, and general purpose frontend to Latex? Good question...</li>
</ul>
