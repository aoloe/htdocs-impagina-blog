<p>Today, I've had the chance to read an older post by Google's former employee <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com">Steve Yegge</a></p>

<p>Since the rant is quite long, I dare to post the first two – out of three – points from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Yegge#Accidental_posting">Wikipedia's summary</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>"That one last thing that Google doesn't do well is Platforms. We don't understand platforms. We don't "get" platforms. Some of you do, but you are the minority. This has become painfully clear to me over the past six years. I was kind of hoping that competitive pressure from Microsoft and Amazon and more recently Facebook would make us wake up collectively and start doing universal services. Not in some sort of ad-hoc, half-assed way, but in more or less the same way Amazon did it: all at once, for real, no cheating, and treating it as our top priority from now on."</li>
<li>"We don't have a Steve Jobs here. I'm sorry, but we don't."</li>
<li>(For the curious but lazy ones: the third point was about Google being blinded by its huge success... not sure it applies to the Scribus project...)</li>
</ul>

<p>Scribus is not Google. No. It's not. But I tend to see in this</p>

<ul>
<li>We should not see Scribus has the holy program that people have to use for publishing, but a platform that people are using in a workflow for publishing.</li>
<li>We are no Wizards, we have to enable our users to shape their workflow as they see fit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our most deep thoughts should be geared to empower the users, not to give them enven more constraints in their workflow.</p>

<p>Personally, I see the future of publishing in workflow where multiple sources, from multiple authors, are prepared by mutliple editors for multiple outputs: can a monolytic software be successful?</p>
