<p>While going through the method loading the tools settings for the current document, I had a hard time finding a good way of storing them in memory.</p>

<p>Guess what? We don't need them! A tool should not have settings which are document specific. But every tool should have styles. And have a default style, which somehow has a similar effect as the document settings: but at the end it's much better. Believe me.</p>

<p>For now, it won't have much effect on the reading and writing of <code>.SLA</code> files:</p>

<ul>
<li>For the tool that already have styles in Scribus, we will ignore the settings defined in the <code>.SLA</code> being loaded, read all the styles inclusive the default ones, and then use the default style to set the document settings when exporting again to a <code>.SLA</code> file. While this implies a lost of information, I'm confident that very few people are consciously using the tool document settings in a way that they would be harmed by this behavior. But if somebody nicely asks (and can prove a real use case) we will certainly add the option to create a default style based on the <code>.SLA</code>'s document settings, which then will be used on export!</li>
<li>For the all other tools, we will simply read from the settings, store it as a style and write it again as a setting when exporting to a <code>.SLA</code> file. For now, it the difference will be on the semantic level.</li>
</ul>

<p>And now, let's concentrating on adding all the document settings.</p>
