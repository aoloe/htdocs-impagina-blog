<p>Here one of the most common feedbacks I get, when I talk about future software projects: do it in the browser!</p>

<p>(To be honest, I also get just as many: "Please, don't do it in the browser"...)</p>

<p>I'm not sold to that idea, but seeing <a href="http://cmx.io">what Antonin Hildebrand could do over a weekend</a>, one really starts to seriously rethink his own prejudices:</p>

<p>An interesting mixture of</p>

<ul>
<li>visual editing of graphical elements and</li>
<li>manual tweaking of XML items!</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, there is a very inspiring <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5209096">comment</a> on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> by the author himself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to provide a nice blend between visual editing and source code editing (I'm a developer). Poses and transformations should be edited visually, but scene structure should be edited by hand via the code. This way you get total control over document structure. Creating good visual-only editor would require too much work and maybe it is not possible at all. Do you know any successful FrontPage-style HTML editor? Quite frankly, I don't need it myself, so that is the primary reason, I'm probably not going to build it at this point.</p>
  
  <p>Heads should be customizable in the future: <a href="https://github.com/darwin/cmx.js/blob/master/app/lib/cmx/entities/actor.coffee#L88">https://github.com/darwin/cmx.js/blob/master/app/lib/cmx/entities/actor.coffee#L88</a></p>
  
  <p>Actually the system already supports attach points, so you can attach items to hands, foots and necks (right now the bubble is attached by default to a head bone).</p>
  
  <p>The last generic piece which is missing will be <code>&lt;drawing&gt;</code> element. Right now it just allows you to specify lines. In the future it will enable you to insert any SVG which is convertible down to paths. I will just resample them and convert them into XKCD-style lines while keeping other styling. This will enable you to insert arbitrary SVG drawings in the scene. I won't create web-based photoshop for SVGs, I will let you import SVG created in other tools as long it is convertible to paths. Imagine it as embedding bitmap images into HTML files. This will be similar idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are still lot of issues to be solved before going for a web or a Webkit application... but – who knows? – it may be the good direction!</p>
