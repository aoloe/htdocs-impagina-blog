<p>After having found out how to create and load plugins with Qt (well, I still have to find out how to compile the plugins when the main project is compiled... but this can wait for now), I've started bothering about loading a .SLA file. It will be the first plugin.</p>

<p>Scribus, after some curves here and there in the code, does the main the work in the the <code>plugins/fileloader/scribus150format/scribus150format.cpp</code> file: 6000+ LOC with "random" calls to other parts of code.</p>

<p>This file could use a little bit of refactoring, but I don't know <code>QXmlStreamReader</code> well enough to just start coding.<br />
So I spent a couple of hours, going through the <code>Scribus150Format::loadFile()</code> method and a very simple (one dummy text frame and one image frame) .SLA. The result is a <a href="https://github.com/impagina/core/blob/read_sla/documentation/sla_15.dtd">minimal DTD</a> (the file will be moving as soon as I merge the branch, but I promise that I will publish the final DTD somewhere!).<br />
Hopefully, it will be a precious help for my further work on the file loader!</p>
