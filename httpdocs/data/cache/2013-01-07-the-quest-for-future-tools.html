<p>Most of you know about it: in the last few years I got more and more involved in the Scribus community and, more generally, in the world of free software for graphics. And now the news: in 2013 lot of things will be different! A "small revolution" that follows two unrelated events from the last few months of 2012.</p>

<p>The first event was Femke's announcement of the device for the LGM 2013: "Future tools". I must admit that my first reaction has been: "Where do you see any future tool?". Please, don't tell her. With the time I got used to it, started liking the idea and even got so far as collecting thoughts about Future tools for publishing. It's still just a bunch of wild ideas and all I currently know is: an Epub plugin for Scribus is not enough for the future of publishing. I wanted to dig further.</p>

<p>A bit later, towards the end of last year, we got an email from Christoph announcing the plans for a release candidate of Scribus 1.5.0. Two things stroke me:</p>

<ul>
<li>He plans one full year to get to a release candidate for a development version (after two and a half years of work on the branch!)</li>
<li>None of the features I care about were among the tasks to be achieved until then.<br />
I started wondering if, with a year of work, a motivated team couldn't produce something that -- while obviously not being better than Scribus -- would better meet the publishing needs for many more people.</li>
</ul>

<p>Short before the end of last year, I've taken the decision: During the next few months, I won't do any support nor community work for Scribus. I won't disappear: but I will use those channels for my needs and won't be there to help other people with their sorrows.<br />
I will certainly finish the tasks I've started (the Epub plugin, the translation into Italian of the Scribus book, ...), but I want to reserve much more time for experimenting with new ideas and new technologies. More details will follow very soon!
